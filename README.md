# Arduino
For various IOT project on Arduino using esp01 module

1. Hardware_serial_test is for tesing whether your esp01 wifi module is working or not this can be used for any Arduino board having only one serial communication channel.

 2.Software_serial_test is for tesing whether your esp01 wifi module is working or not this can be used for any Arduino board having more than one serial communication channel.
 
  3.Blink is the code which blinks the led connected with the esp01 on GPIO2 pin when client is connecetd or not connected it works on TCP/IP socket connected.
  
  4.Connection is the file which shows how to connect esp01 with arduino to upload code on esp01 module.
